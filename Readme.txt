Project 3: Implementing Patterns 2
By: Jacob Narowski
UML : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C7srtfj83QNOTbvJQTP7Lsoc5OapLgAy/view?usp=sharing

To run:
javaw Main.java
java Main

My Project is split into two parts (One in each file: Visitor and Builder)

Both folders have their own run Main.java file which can be used to run the code.
Each folder also has its own readme which goes into detail about each demo implementation.

As an over view:

Visitor is an employee management system
    In main, employees of different types are created and then can be visited by other methods that do different things,
    In my demo the employees can be Trained or Paid
    Visitor pattern is good for this helping the code satisfy single responsibility principle by separating the functions
