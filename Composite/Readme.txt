Composite Readme

This code is a basic implementation of the Composite pattern.

My pattern is designed to track the time it takes an operation to occur.
Each step has its own time that it takes to occur.
Composites are a way to combine different steps and group them together in a logical manner.
In my demo I launch a space ship. You can see me set up each step in three different stages.
Each stage is its own composite.
And every stage is combined together into one overall composite.

Main is the client
Component is the interface for all the objects
Composite is a combination of the Components
Step is a leaf
